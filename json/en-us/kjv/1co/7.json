But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.","8":"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.","9":"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.","10":"And unto the married I command,","11":"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to","12":"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.","13":"And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.","14":"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.","15":"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such","16":"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save","17":"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk.
