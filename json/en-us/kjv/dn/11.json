Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than","3":"And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.","4":"And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.","5":"And the king of the south shall be strong, and","6":"And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king\u2019s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in","7":"But out of a branch of her roots shall","8":"And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes,","9":"So the king of the south shall come into","10":"But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and","11":"And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him,","12":"And","13":"For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.","14":"And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.","15":"So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither","16":"But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.","17":"He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand","18":"After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause","19":"Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.","20":"Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes","21":"And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.","22":"And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.","23":"And after the league","24":"He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do","25":"And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.","26":"Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.","27":"And both these kings\u2019 hearts","28":"Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart","29":"At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.","30":"For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.","31":"And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily","32":"And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do","33":"And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil,","34":"Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.","35":"And","36":"And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.","37":"Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.","38":"But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.","39":"Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge","40":"And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.","41":"He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many","42":"He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.","43":"But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians","44":"But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.","45":"And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain;
