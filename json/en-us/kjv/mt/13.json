The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?","29":"But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.","30":"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.","31":"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying,","32":"Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.","33":"Another parable spake he unto them;","34":"All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:","35":"That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.","36":"Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.","37":"He answered and said unto them,","38":"The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked","39":"The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.","40":"As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.","41":"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;","42":"And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","43":"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.","44":"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.","45":"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:","46":"Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.","48":"Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.","49":"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,","50":"And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.","51":"Jesus saith unto them,","52":"Then said he unto them,","53":"And it came to pass,","54":"And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this","55":"Is not this the carpenter\u2019s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?","56":"And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this","57":"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them,","58":"And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief."}}
