Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste,","2":"He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads","3":"In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.","4":"And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard","5":"My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives","6":"For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.","7":"Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.","8":"For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.","9":"For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land."}}
