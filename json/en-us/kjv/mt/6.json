Thy will be done in earth, as","11":"Give us this day our daily bread.","12":"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.","13":"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.","14":"For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:","15":"But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.","17":"But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;","18":"That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.","20":"But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:","21":"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.","22":"The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.","23":"But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great","25":"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?","26":"Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?","27":"Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?","28":"And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:","29":"And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.","30":"Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven,","31":"Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?","32":"(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.","33":"But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.","34":"Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day"}}
